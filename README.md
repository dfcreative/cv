# [CV](http://registry.jsonresume.org/dfcreative)

[jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) schema is used.

To publish/manage resume use [resume-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resume-cli) tool.

Master branch [resume.json](resume.json) contains all the information.

For specialized versions create branches, like `manager`, `frontend`, or `sales-ru`.
Branches are better than alternate files, as they keep `resume.json` file name unchanged and you may easily publish an alternate version of the resume.
